                    The Student Management Portal allows educators to manage student information 
                    efficiently. This includes adding new students, viewing details, editing records, 
                    and removing students when necessary. The portal streamlines the administrative 
                    tasks involved in managing student data, making it easier to track student progress 
                    and maintain accurate records.
                </p>

                    With our user-friendly interface, you can easily navigate through the different 
                    sections, ensuring a seamless experience for both administrators and students.
